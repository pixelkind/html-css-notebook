### A HTML & CSS Notebook for Visual Studio Code

With the HTML & CSS Notebook extension for Visual Studio Code you can easily create Notebooks that run HTML and CSS code.

You can create code cells with HTML code and combine them with cells that contain CSS code to see the result combining both of them together.

If you execute a specific cell, all cells upon to this cell will be executed but not further. That means it works differently compared to regular Jupyter notebooks where you can run cells in any order and execute a single cell only.
